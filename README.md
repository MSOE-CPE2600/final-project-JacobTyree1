# Voting Machine System

This project implements a voting machine system. 
It consists of a server that manages voting, and multiple clients can cast votes to the server. After casting the vote, the server prints out the updated results. Security features were added to ensure that a single terminal cannot vote more than once. 

## Features 
- Allows clients to cast votes for predefined candidates
- Displays live voting results on the server
- Prevents duplicate votes from the same client
- Support multiple client connections simultaneously. 

## Compiling the program
- GCC compiler
- Make command (easier compilation)
